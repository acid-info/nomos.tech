Building Nomos is a team of passionate and experienced blockchain developers and researchers. 

Alongside Nomos' project lead is a team of researchers and developers with experience as software engineers both within and beyond the web3 ecosystem, and in academia.

At this stage of development, the group of contributors working on Nomos is small, meaning it has a loose, fluid structure. As more contributors join to work on the network, we expect to revise the structure detailed here. 

Nomos is keen to work with other contributors. If you share our passion for decentralisation, individual sovereignty and privacy, we'd love to hear from you. As an open-source project, we also welcome community contributions. Please check out our [Github repo here](https://github.com/logos-co).
