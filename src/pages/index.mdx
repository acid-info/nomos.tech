        'Nomos is prioritizing privacy for both users and infrastructure providers. At the app level developers choose how much identifying and transaction information users may disclose, while validators and delegators are able to shield their participation in the network.',

      description:
        "Communities have the ability to adopt the initial network state, or fork it based on a new set of rules they wish to establish. Users may remain on the initial blockchain, migrate to the new one, or be in both.",

        'Nomos has an integrated modular architecture separating data availability, coordination, and execution. Modular design is essential for combining decentralization with scalability through layer-specific resource pricing.',

      title: 'Adaptability',
      description:
        "Privacy and sovereignty are fundamental to Nomos' mission. Because they exist on a spectrum, Nomos is building mechanisms that allow both to be adapted and expanded based on the needs and maturity of a network state.",
